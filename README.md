When you first open the app, there is a home page that displays some of the artworks retrieved from the Art Institute of Chicago API. After navigating to the "ARTWORKS" page, you can click on an artwork to view more information about it, including its title, artist, and date.

To add an artwork to your favorites list, click the "Add to favorites" button. To remove an artwork from your favorites list, click the "Remove from favorites" button.

You can toggle between the list of all artworks and your favorites list by clicking the "Show Favorites" button. When you are viewing your favorites list, you can click the "Back to Display of Artworks" button to return to the list of all artworks.

You can also navigate to the "SEARCH" page to search for an artwork in the Art Institute of Chicago library. When you hover over an artwork card, you will be able to see its title and the name of the artist.
